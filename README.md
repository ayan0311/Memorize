# Memorize
Stanford CS193p Card Game app written by me on my own adding custom themes, adding themes, managing themes, 
custom colors, added a search bar for themes, added start and restart buttons and a simple scoring system and high score system. 
The high score &amp; list of themes are stored in UserDefaults being very small data / datasets.

Feel free to clone the code if you are still going through the course and want to take help by looking at the code I wrote and used.
